## Source

This firmware is the one used by Thomas Roth ([stacksmashing](https://stacksmashing.net/)) in his YouTube
video [Bare-metal ARM firmware reverse
engineering with Ghidra and SVD-Loader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4CxE5P6RUE).
The binary is originally available at [ghidraninja/arm-bare-metal-1](https://github.com/ghidraninja/arm-bare-metal-1),
but is included in this repository for convenience: [blink.bin](blink.bin)
