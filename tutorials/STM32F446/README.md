## Source

This firmware is the one used by Thomas Roth (stacksmashing) in his YouTube video *"Bare-metal ARM firmware reverse
engineering with Ghidra and SVD-Loader"*.
The binary is originally available at **[ghidraninja/arm-bare-metal-1](https://github.com/ghidraninja/arm-bare-metal-1)
**, but is included in this repository for convenience: [blink.bin](blink.bin)
